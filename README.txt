This is a Windows Phone Application that provides a relatively complete view over a user's facebook account.

This include viewing friends, photos, feed, notes, groups, page, comments, likes, etc. all linkd to gether.

What is particularly bold about this project is that both UI and Model is designed specifically to work best with asynchronous calls that ultimately gives the user a very smooth user experience with zero-lag over actions they perform.


What are those folders!

- FaceFeed: This is the main UI project that includes all pages and modules and project configurations.
- FaceFeed.Model: This is the Data Model of the application.
- FaceFeed.Tasks: This is the Background Task project, responsible for reminders, etc.
